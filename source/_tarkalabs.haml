    %p As the CTO of TarkaLabs, I engage with clients in technology consulting and building a team of brilliant engineers. I also oversee development practices and help choose and build tools that are most appropriate to the business problem at hand. I also do a bit of public speaking and workshops on technologies such as Javascript and Clojure. I worked closely with an account since inception and grew it to support close to $1mn in revenue.

    %p I launched our product offerings by collaborating with the EAM 360 team to launch our first Product. I also coordinate with our vendors to build the mobile suite of EAM 360 on both Android and the iOS platforms.
